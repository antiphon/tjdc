Title: Trends and Jumps in DataCubes
Version: 0.9
Author: Tuomas Rajala
Maintainer: Tuomas Rajala <tuomas.rajala@iki.fi>
Description: Fit a statistical model for detecting pixel level trends and sudden 
  jumps in time-series on spatial grid's nodes, i.e. stars-class datacubes. 
  The focus is on analysing many short and noisy timeserieses and improving the 
  changepoint detection by incorporating information from neighbour pixels using a 
  Potts prior for the time-of-events.
